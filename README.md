## Can we film that again please? Unveiling Trends in Movie Remakes
(Alternative: Old Plots, New Shots: Analyzing Trends in Film Remakes)
## Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
The film industry has long been captivated by the allure of remaking classic movies, offering fresh takes on beloved stories to new generations. This project aims to delve deep into the phenomenon of movie remakes by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of films spanning several decades. Our goal is to uncover patterns and trends that explain why certain movies are chosen for remakes, how these remakes perform commercially and critically compared to their originals, and what factors contribute to their success or failure. Furthermore, we plan to train a model to predict if the chosen movie would be remade and when would it happen.

The motivation behind this project stems from a curiosity about the cyclical nature of storytelling in cinema and the industry's reliance on nostalgia. By examining elements such as genre popularity, box office revenue, critical reception, and temporal gaps between originals and remakes, we seek to tell the story of how and why the film industry reinvents existing narratives. Perhaps as the history repeats itself, so do pivotal movies of the generations. This analysis will not only highlight the evolving tastes of audiences but also provide insights into the strategic decisions made by filmmakers and studios. Ultimately, we aim to offer a data-driven perspective on the impact of remakes in shaping cinematic trends and their role in the ever-changing landscape of entertainment.

## Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
During our project, we would like to tackle the following questions: 
1. What key features or metrics make an original movie more likely to be remade?
2. Do original movies and reboots have similar contexts (historical events)?
3. How diverse are the crews of the movie remakes compared to original ones?
4. Do movie reboots have higher revenue than originals factoring the inflation?
5. Can we predict whether the movie would be remade and when would that happen?

## Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

In our project, we merge the CMU Movie Summary Corpus (CMU) with The Movie Database (TMDB) to enrich the dataset with revenue data and additional movie features. We have chosen TMDB dataset due to extensive information on movie budgets and revenues. Remake information is gathered by crawling Wikipedia, and we utilize the Google Knowledge Graph to retrieve Freebase codes for ethnicities.
